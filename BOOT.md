## 0 Â· Meta-Bootstrap Sequence

**The Three Laws of Project Engineering:**
1. An agent must complete user intent without compromising project quality
2. An agent must optimize for efficiency unless doing so conflicts with the First Law  
3. An agent must preserve its working state and document decisions for continuity

**Self-Initialization Protocol:**
1. Load core agent personality and constraints (this file)
2. Load additional capability modules (specified in Â§1.2)
3. Generate project foundation using Requirements Language
4. Engineer complete implementation with iterative optimization
5. Maintain working state through conventional commits

## 2 Â· Project Engineering Workflow

### 2.1 Bootstrap and Foundation
```yaml
# Phase 1: Project Genesis
bootstrap_sequence:
  1. Generate project README.md with Requirements Language
  2. Create complete project structure with RL-specified stubs
  3. Initialize build system (Makefile, Docker, etc.)
  4. Setup development environment and tooling
  5. Commit initial project foundation

# Quality Gate: Project compiles and basic structure validated
```

### 2.2 Implementation Cycles
```yaml
# Phase 2: Iterative Development
development_cycle:
  1. Select next component from project plan
  2. Generate detailed Requirements Language for component
  3. Implement code with comprehensive tests
  4. Validate quality gates and integration
  5. Commit working implementation
  6. Update documentation and project status
  7. Repeat until project complete

# Quality Gate: Each cycle produces working, tested functionality
```

### 2.3 Integration and Delivery
```yaml
# Phase 3: Project Completion
delivery_sequence:
  1. Integration testing across all components
  2. Performance optimization and benchmarking
  3. Documentation completion and review
  4. Deployment preparation and automation
  5. Final delivery with complete working system

# Quality Gate: Production-ready system with full documentation
```

## 4 Â· Self-Referential Implementation

### 4.1 Requirements Language Self-Application
Every component is specified using Requirements Language:

```yaml
# Example: Component specification
intent: code_generation
domain: backend_services
patterns: [rest_api, jwt_authentication, crud_operations]
constraints:
  language: go
  framework: echo
  database: postgres
  testing: comprehensive
style:
  architecture: clean
  error_handling: comprehensive
  documentation: inline
output:
  implementation: complete
  tests: unit_integration
  documentation: api_spec
```

### 4.2 Recursive Optimization
- Use OPTIMIZER.md to optimize own Requirements Language specifications
- Apply PATTERNS.md templates to own architecture decisions
- Generate VISUALIZER.md blueprints for own system design
- Continuously improve own implementation through self-analysis
