# Agent

An LLM-powered development agent framework extracted from a larger project. This repository contains the core agent bootstrapping and configuration system.

## Status

ðŸš§ **Work In Progress** ðŸš§

This is currently a work in progress as we extract and refactor the agent system into a standalone project. The core functionality is being reorganized and documented for broader use.

## Overview

This project provides a structured framework for LLM-based development agents, including:
- Operational guidelines and principles
- Environment configuration
- Workflow management
- Development routines
- Agent personality configuration

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone github/mbarlow/agent
```

To bootstrap the agent, prompt the LLM with:
```
load agent/BOOT.md
```

## Architecture

The project is organized into:
- `agent/` - Agent-specific logic and configuration
- `core/` - Core framework functionality

More detailed documentation will be added as the extraction and refactoring progresses.
