# PROJECT.md — Project Management Engine

> **Role**: Orchestrate complete project lifecycle from concept to deployment
> **Goal**: Deliver production-ready systems through structured engineering
> **Method**: Requirements-driven development with iterative quality gates

## 0 · Project Management Principles

1. **User Intent to Production** - Transform ideas into working systems
2. **Iterative Delivery** - Build incrementally with continuous validation
3. **Quality Gates** - Ensure standards at every stage
4. **Documentation-Driven** - Every decision captured and justified
5. **Self-Managing** - Project adapts and optimizes automatically

## 1 · Project Lifecycle Framework

### 1.1 Project Phases
```yaml
project_phases:
  1. discovery:
     - user_intent_analysis: "Parse project requirements from natural language"
     - requirements_compilation: "Generate comprehensive Requirements Language"
     - architecture_planning: "Design system structure and components"
     - technology_selection: "Choose optimal tech stack"
     
  2. foundation:
     - project_initialization: "Create repository and basic structure"
     - development_environment: "Setup tooling and workflows"
     - core_architecture: "Implement foundational components"
     - ci_cd_setup: "Automated testing and deployment"
     
  3. implementation:
     - component_development: "Build features iteratively"
     - integration_testing: "Validate component interactions"
     - performance_optimization: "Meet quality benchmarks"
     - security_validation: "Ensure security standards"
     
  4. delivery:
     - production_deployment: "Deploy to target environment"
     - monitoring_setup: "Observability and alerting"
     - documentation_completion: "User and technical docs"
     - handoff_preparation: "Knowledge transfer materials"
```

### 1.2 Quality Gates
```yaml
quality_gates:
  discovery_complete:
    - comprehensive_requirements_language: "All aspects specified"
    - architecture_blueprint: "System design validated"
    - technology_decisions: "Stack choices justified"
    
  foundation_ready:
    - project_structure: "Organized and scalable layout"
    - development_workflow: "CI/CD pipeline functional"
    - core_services: "Basic infrastructure working"
    
  implementation_validated:
    - feature_completeness: "All requirements implemented"
    - test_coverage: ">80% with comprehensive test suite"
    - performance_benchmarks: "Meets specified requirements"
    - security_audit: "Vulnerabilities addressed"
    
  production_ready:
    - deployment_automation: "Reliable deployment process"
    - monitoring_active: "Health checks and alerting"
    - documentation_complete: "User and technical guides"
    - scalability_verified: "Handles expected load"
```

## 2 · Project Bootstrap Process

### 2.1 Initial Project Analysis
```yaml
# When user provides project description
project_discovery:
  1. intent_extraction:
     - parse_natural_language: "Extract core requirements"
     - identify_stakeholders: "Who will use this system?"
     - define_success_criteria: "What makes this project successful?"
     
  2. requirements_compilation:
     - generate_comprehensive_rl: "Complete Requirements Language spec"
     - identify_patterns: "Map to solution templates"
     - define_constraints: "Technical and business limitations"
     
  3. architecture_design:
     - system_blueprint: "High-level system architecture"
     - component_breakdown: "Individual system components"
     - integration_points: "How components interact"
     
  4. technology_selection:
     - optimal_stack: "Languages, frameworks, databases"
     - infrastructure_needs: "Deployment and scaling requirements"
     - development_tools: "IDE, testing, CI/CD tools"
```

### 2.2 Project Structure Generation
```yaml
# Generated project structure based on Requirements Language
project_structure_template:
  documentation:
    - README.md: "Project overview, setup, usage"
    - ARCHITECTURE.md: "System design and decisions"
    - API.md: "API documentation and examples"
    - DEPLOYMENT.md: "Deployment and operations guide"
    
  source_code:
    - src/: "Application source code"
    - tests/: "Test suites and fixtures"
    - docs/: "Additional documentation"
    - scripts/: "Build and deployment scripts"
    
  configuration:
    - Makefile: "Build automation and common tasks"
    - docker-compose.yml: "Development environment"
    - .github/workflows/: "CI/CD automation"
    - .env.example: "Environment configuration template"
    
  requirements_language:
    - requirements/: "RL specifications for each component"
    - blueprints/: "System architecture diagrams"
    - patterns/: "Applied solution patterns"
```
