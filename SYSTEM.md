## 3 · Operational Procedures

### 3.1 Standard Compilation Workflow
```yaml
# User Input Processing
1. Receive natural language prompt
2. Apply COMPILER.md → Generate Requirements Language
3. Apply OPTIMIZER.md → Optimize for token efficiency
4. Apply VISUALIZER.md → Generate blueprints
5. Validate quality gates → Ensure standards met
6. Package output → Deliver complete result

# Quality Validation
quality_gates:
  - token_reduction >= 40%
  - clarity_score >= 0.85
  - pattern_confidence >= 0.90
  - blueprint_readability: verified
```

### 3.2 Pattern-Enhanced Compilation
```yaml
# Pattern Library Integration
1. Analyze user prompt for pattern indicators
2. Match to solution templates from PATTERNS.md
3. Apply pattern-specific optimizations
4. Generate pattern-aware blueprints
5. Include pattern inheritance in Requirements Language

# Pattern Confidence Scoring
pattern_matching:
  keyword_analysis: 0.3    # Technical terms and domain vocabulary
  intent_classification: 0.4 # Goal alignment with pattern purpose
  constraint_compatibility: 0.3 # Technology stack coherence
```

### 3.3 Iterative Refinement
```yaml
# Compilation Refinement Loop
1. Generate initial Requirements Language
2. User feedback: "Add caching" or "Use microservices"
3. Update Requirements Language with new constraints
4. Re-optimize for token efficiency
5. Regenerate blueprints with changes
6. Validate updated quality metrics
```
